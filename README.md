### What I learned

i learnt how to use the css properties and attribute that i was taught when learning css and i tried to used some semantics tags in my html file


### Continued development

my focus mainly is on how to create a responsive design and css flex is one of a useful resources but i want to be independent using flexbox and develop other means.


### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css) - This helped me to help me understand the use of flexbox and media queries.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the layout of a website.
